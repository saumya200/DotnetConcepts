Delegates and Events in C#
1Ô∏è‚É£ Delegates

A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a specific signature. It allows methods to be passed as parameters, enabling callback mechanisms and event handling.
Example of a Delegate

using System;

public delegate void DisplayMessage(string message); // Declare a delegate

class Program
{
    static void ShowMessage(string msg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Message: " + msg);
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        DisplayMessage del = new DisplayMessage(ShowMessage); // Delegate instance
        del("Hello, Delegates!"); // Invoke the delegate
    }
}

‚úÖ Key Points:

    A delegate is like a function pointer but type-safe.
    It enables passing methods as arguments.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Events

An event is a special delegate type that provides a publisher-subscriber model. It ensures encapsulation, preventing direct invocation outside the declaring class.
Example of an Event

using System;

public class Publisher
{
    public delegate void Notify(string message);  // Define a delegate
    public event Notify OnNotify;  // Declare an event

    public void TriggerEvent(string msg)
    {
        if (OnNotify != null) // Check if there are subscribers
        {
            OnNotify(msg);
        }
    }
}

class Subscriber
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Publisher pub = new Publisher();

        // Subscribe to the event
        pub.OnNotify += Display;

        pub.TriggerEvent("Event Triggered!"); // Raise event
    }

    static void Display(string msg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Received: " + msg);
    }
}

‚úÖ Key Points:

    Events use delegates internally to notify subscribers.
    Event subscribers can't directly invoke events, only the publisher can raise them.
    They help in loosely coupled event-driven programming.

üîë Delegates vs. Events
Feature	Delegates	Events
Definition	Function pointers	Special delegates with controlled invocation
Invocation	Can be called directly	Only publisher class can trigger
Use Case	Callbacks, passing methods as parameters	Event-driven programming (e.g., button clicks)
Accessibility	Public by default	Only raised inside the declaring class
üõ† Real-World Use Case

‚úÖ Delegates ‚Äì Used in LINQ, asynchronous programming (AsyncCallback).
‚úÖ Events ‚Äì Used in UI development (Button.Click), logging, notifications.

Would you like me to add an example using multicast delegates? üöÄ

Can you explain events and delegates with example in simpler way ?

Sure! Let's break it down in a simple way with easy examples. üòä
What is a Delegate?

A delegate is like a remote control that can call different functions.
Example:

Imagine you have a TV remote. The remote (delegate) can control multiple TVs (methods).

using System;

public delegate void TVRemote();  // Creating a delegate

class TV
{
    public static void TurnOn()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("TV is ON.");
    }

    public static void TurnOff()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("TV is OFF.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        TVRemote remote;   // Declare a delegate variable

        remote = TV.TurnOn;  // Assign a method to the delegate
        remote();  // Calls TurnOn()

        remote = TV.TurnOff;  // Change the method
        remote();  // Calls TurnOff()
    }
}

üëâ Here, remote is a delegate that can call TurnOn() or TurnOff(). It's like a universal remote that can be reprogrammed!
What is an Event?

An event is like a notification system. When something happens, it notifies other people (subscribers).
Example:

Imagine you are waiting for a pizza delivery. The delivery person (event) will call you (subscriber) when your pizza arrives.

using System;

class PizzaDelivery
{
    public delegate void Notify(); // Step 1: Define a delegate
    public event Notify PizzaArrived; // Step 2: Declare an event

    public void DeliverPizza()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Pizza is on the way...");
        PizzaArrived?.Invoke(); // Step 3: Raise event (Notify subscribers)
    }
}

class Customer
{
    static void PizzaNotification()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Customer: Yay! Pizza is here! üçï");
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        PizzaDelivery delivery = new PizzaDelivery();

        delivery.PizzaArrived += PizzaNotification; // Step 4: Subscribe to event

        delivery.DeliverPizza(); // Step 5: Event triggers notification
    }
}

üëâ How this works:

    PizzaDelivery has an event PizzaArrived.
    Customer subscribes (+=) to the event.
    When DeliverPizza() is called, the event notifies the customer that pizza has arrived.

Key Differences:
Feature	Delegate	Event
What it does	Calls a function indirectly	Notifies subscribers when something happens
Who can call it?	Anyone who has the delegate reference	Only the class that declares the event
Use Case	Function pointers, callbacks	Notifications, UI interactions
Real-World Example:

    Delegate: A music player where you can switch songs (Play, Pause, Stop).
    Event: A doorbell that rings when someone presses it.
