------------------------🚀 Understanding Lazy Loading & Eager Loading in EF Core ---------------------------------------------------------

Imagine you own a toy store 🏪, and you have a big toy catalog 📖 that lists all the toys, their prices, and which customers bought them.

1️⃣ Lazy Loading = You only check toy names first, and later look at customer details if needed.
2️⃣ Eager Loading = You check everything at once (toy names + customer details) in one go.
🔎 What is Lazy Loading? (Slow and On-Demand)

Lazy loading is like being lazy 💤 and fetching extra details only when needed.
🏪 Example: A Customer Wants a Toy List

A customer asks, "What toys do you have?"

    You only show toy names at first. ✅
    If they ask, "Who bought this toy?", you then check customer details. ✅

💡 In EF Core, Lazy Loading works the same way! It only loads the main data first and fetches related data later if needed.
📝 Code Example of Lazy Loading

public class Toy  
{  
    public int Id { get; set; }  
    public string Name { get; set; }  
    public decimal Price { get; set; }  
    public virtual List<Order> Orders { get; set; }  // Lazy Loaded  
}

Fetching Data with Lazy Loading

using (var context = new ToyStoreContext())  
{  
    var toy = context.Toys.FirstOrDefault(t => t.Name == "Teddy Bear"); // Only toy data is loaded  
    var orders = toy.Orders; // Orders are loaded **only when accessed**
}

🔴 EF Core does not load orders at first (Only loads the Toy).
🔵 When you access toy.Orders, EF Core fetches the related data.
🚀 What is Eager Loading? (Fast and All-at-Once)

Eager loading means loading everything at once, even if you don’t need all of it.
🏪 Example: A Customer Wants a Full Toy Report

A customer asks, "Give me a list of toys AND who bought them."

    You fetch toy names AND customer details together immediately. ✅

💡 In EF Core, Eager Loading works the same way! It loads the main data and related data at the same time.
📝 Code Example of Eager Loading

using (var context = new ToyStoreContext())  
{  
    var toysWithOrders = context.Toys.Include(t => t.Orders).ToList();  // Fetch Toys + Orders together  
}

🔵 Now, EF Core fetches everything in one query!

SELECT * FROM Toys  
JOIN Orders ON Toys.Id = Orders.ToyId;

✅ Faster for bulk data retrieval.
✅ Prevents multiple database hits (better performance).
📊 Lazy Loading vs Eager Loading – Which One to Use?
Feature	Lazy Loading 💤	Eager Loading 🚀
When Data is Loaded	Only when accessed	Loaded immediately
Performance	Faster for small queries	Faster for large data sets
Number of Queries	Multiple small queries	One big query
Best For	Small apps where related data is rarely used	Large apps where related data is always needed

💡 Use Lazy Loading when:

    You don’t always need related data.
    You want to save memory and load extra data only when required.

💡 Use Eager Loading when:

    You always need related data (e.g., Showing all toys with customer purchases).
    You want to avoid multiple database hits (better for performance).


    ------------------------------REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS FOR LAZY LOADING--------------------------------------------------------------------
    📌 1️⃣ Real-World Scenario for Lazy Loading 💤
🛒 E-Commerce Website (Product Listings)

Imagine you have an e-commerce website like Amazon 🛍️.

    The homepage only shows product names and prices (you don’t need reviews, seller info, etc., immediately).
    When a user clicks on a product, then you load detailed information (reviews, seller details, stock availability, etc.).

How Lazy Loading Helps Here:

    It keeps the homepage fast by loading only essential data first.
    It fetches extra details only when the user requests them.

🔵 Example in EF Core:

var products = context.Products.ToList();  // Loads only product names and prices  
var reviews = products[0].Reviews;  // Reviews are loaded only when accessed

👉 EF Core loads reviews only when the user clicks on a product.

✔ Best for: Apps where related data is not always needed, like product details, comments, or logs.


------------------------------------------------REAL-WORLD SCENARIOS FOR EAGER LOADING------------------------------------------------------

📌 2️⃣ Real-World Scenario for Eager Loading 🚀
📊 Employee Management System (HR Software)

Imagine a company HR system that shows all employees and their departments in a single dashboard.

    You always need Employee details + Department information.
    It makes sense to load everything together in one query instead of making multiple calls.

How Eager Loading Helps Here:

    It avoids multiple queries and loads all related data in one request.
    Improves performance because you always need department details anyway.

🔵 Example in EF Core:

var employees = context.Employees.Include(e => e.Department).ToList();

👉 EF Core loads Employees + Departments in a single database call.

✔ Best for: Dashboards, reports, and applications where related data is always needed together.
