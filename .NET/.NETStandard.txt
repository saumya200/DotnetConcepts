---------------------------------------------------What is .NET Standard?-----------------------------------------------------------------

.NET Standard is a formal specification of APIs that different .NET implementations (such as .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin) must 
follow. It acts as a bridge to ensure that libraries can work across multiple .NET platforms.

----->Why was .NET Standard introduced?

Before .NET Standard, developers faced compatibility issues due to multiple .NET platforms:

    .NET Framework (for Windows applications)
    .NET Core (for cross-platform apps)
    Xamarin (for mobile apps)
    Mono/Unity (for game development)

Each had different APIs, making it hard to share code between them. .NET Standard solved this problem by defining a common set of APIs that 
all these platforms must support.

Key Features of .NET Standard

âœ… Platform Independence â€“ Write a library once, use it across different .NET versions.
âœ… Code Reusability â€“ Share common libraries without modification.
âœ… Backward Compatibility â€“ New versions of .NET Standard support older implementations.
.NET Standard vs. .NET Core vs. .NET Framework
Feature	.NET Standard	.NET Core	.NET Framework
What it is	API Specification	Cross-platform runtime	Windows-only runtime
Usage	Defines common APIs	Used for new development	Legacy Windows apps
Platform	Works across all .NET versions	Windows, Linux, macOS	Windows only
Best For	Library development	Modern, cloud, and web apps	Windows-based enterprise apps
Example: Using .NET Standard Library

If you create a .NET Standard class library, it can be used in:

    A .NET Core Web API
    A .NET Framework WPF application
    A Xamarin mobile app

ðŸ“Œ Example of a .NET Standard Library (MathUtils.cs):

namespace Utilities {
    public class MathUtils {
        public static int Add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    }
}

You can then use this library in both .NET Core and .NET Framework projects without modifications.

----->.NET Standard Versions

.NET Standard has multiple versions (e.g., 1.0, 1.6, 2.0, 2.1), each supporting different APIs.

    Higher versions have more features but work with fewer platforms.
    .NET Standard 2.0 is widely used as it supports both .NET Framework (4.6.1+) and .NET Core (2.0+).

---->Is .NET Standard Still Relevant?

With .NET 5+, Microsoft unified .NET Core and .NET Framework into a single platform called .NET.
ðŸ”¹ .NET Standard is no longer needed for new projects, but it is still important for supporting legacy applications and cross-platform 
libraries.

Conclusion

âœ… .NET Standard is a compatibility layer that allows libraries to run on multiple .NET versions.
âœ… .NET 5+ has replaced .NET Standard, but it is still useful for maintaining cross-platform libraries.

ðŸš€ If you're starting a new project, it's better to use .NET 6+ instead of .NET Standard!
