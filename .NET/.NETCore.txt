------------------------------------------------------What is .NET Core?---------------------------------------------------------------------

.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework developed by Microsoft for building modern applications. It is a lightweight, 
high-performance, and modular version of the traditional .NET Framework, designed to run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

------->Key Features of .NET Core:

   1. Cross-Platform – Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, unlike the .NET Framework, which is Windows-only.
   2. Open-Source – Hosted on GitHub, allowing community contributions and transparency.
   3. High Performance – Optimized for speed, making it ideal for cloud applications, microservices, and web APIs.
   4. Modular & Lightweight – Uses NuGet packages, meaning developers can include only the necessary libraries instead of a bulky framework.
   5. Supports Modern Development – Ideal for cloud, microservices, containers (Docker, Kubernetes), and serverless computing.
   6. Unified Development – With .NET 5 and later, Microsoft merged .NET Core and .NET Framework into a single platform called .NET (dropping "Core").

----------->Common Use Cases:

   1. Web Applications & APIs – Using ASP.NET Core
   2. Microservices – Lightweight, scalable services
   3. Cross-Platform Applications – Running on different OSes
   4. Cloud & Serverless Computing – Works well with Azure, AWS, and GCP

-------------------------------------Difference Between .NET Framework & .NET Core:-------------------------------------------------
Feature	                    .NET Framework	                         .NET Core

Platform                    Support	Windows only	           Windows, Linux, macOS

Performance	                Moderate	                               High
Modularity	                Monolithic	                       Modular (NuGet-based)
Use Cases	            Legacy apps, enterprise apps	     Modern web apps, microservices, cloud apps


---------->Current Status of .NET Core:

.NET Core evolved into .NET 5+, making it the future of .NET development. If you're starting a new project, .NET 6, .NET 7, or .NET 8 is 
recommended instead of .NET Core.
