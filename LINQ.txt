----------------🧐 Understanding Queries & LINQ in EF Core----------------------------------------

Imagine Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is like a magic librarian 📚 who helps you find and manage books (data) in a huge library (database).

1️⃣ You ask the librarian for a book → A query to get data from the database.
2️⃣ You tell the librarian to add a new book → A query to insert data.
3️⃣ You tell the librarian to update a book’s price → A query to update data.
4️⃣ You tell the librarian to remove a book → A query to delete data.

In EF Core, we use LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) to talk to the librarian instead of using a complicated book catalog (SQL). 📖✨
🔎 What is LINQ?

LINQ is like asking for books in a simple way instead of searching the entire library manually.

    Without LINQ (SQL): ❌
        You have to write long, difficult queries.
    With LINQ: ✅
        You just describe what you want, and EF Core does the hard work!

🚀 Example 1: Fetching Data (Finding a Book in the Library 📚)
📝 Problem: You want to find all books in the library that cost less than $10.

🔴 Without LINQ (SQL Query):

SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Price < 10;

🔵 With LINQ (EF Core Query):

var cheapBooks = context.Books.Where(b => b.Price < 10).ToList();

💡 What happens?

    context.Books = Your library 📚.
    Where(b => b.Price < 10) = "Find books that are less than $10."
    ToList() = "Give me the list of books."

🔥 EF Core converts this into SQL automatically!
🚀 Example 2: Finding a Specific Book (Searching for Harry Potter 🧙‍♂️)
📝 Problem: You want to find a book called "Harry Potter".

🔴 Without LINQ (SQL Query):

SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Title = 'Harry Potter';

🔵 With LINQ (EF Core Query):

var book = context.Books.FirstOrDefault(b => b.Title == "Harry Potter");

💡 What happens?

    FirstOrDefault() = Finds one book that matches the title.

🚀 Example 3: Sorting Data (Arranging Books from Cheapest to Most Expensive) 📖💰
📝 Problem: You want to sort books by price (low to high).

🔴 Without LINQ (SQL Query):

SELECT * FROM Books ORDER BY Price ASC;

🔵 With LINQ (EF Core Query):

var sortedBooks = context.Books.OrderBy(b => b.Price).ToList();

💡 What happens?

    OrderBy(b => b.Price) = "Sort books by price in ascending order."

🚀 Example 4: Grouping Data (Counting Books by Category) 📊
📝 Problem: You want to count how many books are in each category (e.g., 5 fiction, 3 science, etc.).

🔴 Without LINQ (SQL Query):

SELECT Category, COUNT(*) FROM Books GROUP BY Category;

🔵 With LINQ (EF Core Query):

var bookCountByCategory = context.Books
    .GroupBy(b => b.Category)
    .Select(g => new { Category = g.Key, Count = g.Count() })
    .ToList();

💡 What happens?

    GroupBy(b => b.Category) = Group books by category.
    Select(g => new { Category = g.Key, Count = g.Count() }) = Create a result with category name and book count.

🚀 Example 5: Updating Data (Changing a Book's Price) 🔄
📝 Problem: You want to increase the price of "Harry Potter" to $15.

🔴 Without LINQ (SQL Query):

UPDATE Books SET Price = 15 WHERE Title = 'Harry Potter';

🔵 With LINQ (EF Core Query):

var book = context.Books.FirstOrDefault(b => b.Title == "Harry Potter");
if (book != null)
{
    book.Price = 15;
    context.SaveChanges();  // Save changes to the database
}

💡 What happens?

    Find the book first.
    Change its price.
    SaveChanges() tells EF Core to update the database.

🚀 Example 6: Deleting Data (Removing a Book from the Library 🚮)
📝 Problem: You want to delete "Harry Potter" from the database.

🔴 Without LINQ (SQL Query):

DELETE FROM Books WHERE Title = 'Harry Potter';

🔵 With LINQ (EF Core Query):

var book = context.Books.FirstOrDefault(b => b.Title == "Harry Potter");
if (book != null)
{
    context.Books.Remove(book);
    context.SaveChanges();
}

💡 What happens?

    Find the book.
    Remove it from the library.
    SaveChanges() updates the database.

🔹 Summary

    LINQ helps query databases easily using C# instead of SQL.
    EF Core translates LINQ queries into SQL automatically.
    You can use LINQ to fetch, sort, group, update, and delete data in a simple way.

🎉 How a 5-Year-Old Can Remember This

    LINQ = Asking a librarian for books instead of searching yourself.
    EF Core = Magic librarian who translates your request into SQL.
    Queries = Asking for books (data) in different ways (by title, by price, by category).
